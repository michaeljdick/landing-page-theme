I regularly try to push myself to the limit and learn new skills. [Crossfit](https://crossfit.com/ "Crossfit") is my way to go for getting fit right now. I was introduced to the sport of Crossfit by my good friend and training partner Patrick. He is a certified personal trainer and passionate Crossfitter and I am really proud to call this guy a friend of mine. He has an awesome mindset and motivates me to work hard to turn weaknesses into strengts. Please make sure to follow his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pattreiber/ "Patrick Treiber") and leave him a follow. Earlier this year I startet training at [BASIS](http://basis-karlsruhe.de/ "BASIS Karlsruhe") - a cool box with a cool community! Additionaly, I am really proud to have the priviledge to train at [Buffalo Box](http://www.buffalobox.de/ "Buffalo Box Ettlingen"), the coolest homegym in the word run by my friend and #KettlebellPartnerInCrime [Basti](https://www.instagram.com/buffalobasti/ "Basti Siebenb√ºrger")! Right now, the focus is not on competing but rather work on my weaknesses, but stay tuned for 2018 ;)
